### VSCode Debugger

In a project opened in vscode, you can start debugging by adding some configuration in .vscode/launch.json file. For example:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
  	{
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch", // debug mode: launch ï½œ attach
      "name": "example",
      "file": "${workspcaceFolder}/start-from-scratch.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

The basic principle is similar to chrome devtool. But there exists some differences that vscode debugger need extra adaptor to process a variety of programing language.
